11:16 - I am researching about which microcontrollers or microcontroller board to use on the orpheus goes to space goes to space mission.

11:25 - After researching and considering options, I have come to consider three possibilities, ATtiny 2 series, the RP2040, STM32U5 series

I'm considering RP2040, because of its widespread use, great documentation, and ease of design.

I'm considering ATtiny bcoz of its absolutely amazing power consumption, which is important for a mission this critical. Also its size and weight are greately suited for such an application
