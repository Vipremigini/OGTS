19:42 - I have come to consider three options for the microcontrollers, but I have decided now to focus on consideing the options for the GPS module.

20:13 - there are a lot of options for the GPS module, but there is a limitation that we need to consider called the COCOM. This limits the altitude and speed barriers of the GPS module. which means that if the balloon goes above a certain limit, the GPS model will stop working.
