19:42 - I have come to consider three options for the microcontrollers, but I have decided now to focus on consideing the options for the GPS module.

20:13 - there are a lot of options for the GPS module, but there is a limitation that we need to consider called the COCOM. This limits the altitude and speed barriers of the GPS module. which means that if the balloon goes above a certain limit, the GPS model will stop working.

20:46 - the information that I find are contradicting, sometimes I find that beak balloons only go up to something like 18 km, but sometimes I find information that Picos may go beyond 18 km, so I am confused on which one to consider. and upon further research, I think it all comes down to the specific configuration of the balloon.
