13:07 -  I have decided to try building the pcb using ATtiny85 microcontroller after stumbling upon it through : https://www.hackster.io/aXr/a-complete-guide-to-build-your-own-attiny85-project-pcb-efc2bf
13:43 - My refernces: https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Program-an-Attiny85-From-an-Arduino-Uno/

13:48 - I am only including support for 3.3v battery. Will try to implement solar in next version
13:52 - Only this version will only send LoRa packets at regular intervals (like the original Sputnik). No GPS support
13:54 - This decision has been taken to reduce the weight and cost
